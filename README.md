we hear a lot about how top athletes are improving and about new records, however we do not fully understand
how impressive these people are and how they compare to their predecessors. also it is nice to see how the country's
participating in the Olympics changed, which country improved and which country's lost their golden touch

# Solution

- a website that gives a visualisation of various Olympic results through the years

- MAIN FEATURES: dropdown menu to select a sport and gender, interactive graph that shows the results through the years
  with a tooltip.
  a map of the world where the country's are coloured with corresponding to the amount of medals won, with a tooltip and a graph linked to it.
  a slider can be used to update the map
  *optionally* the amount of people cought for using doping and which doping are represented in a graph
