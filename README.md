# Introduction

Since it is 2018, the winter Olympics are coming up, of course a lot of people are excited for the games and are curious how their nation will do, but how did their nation do in the past compared to other country's? In this project the answer to this question is displayed for both the summer and the winter Olympics along with the history of every modern nation

# Prerequisites

- Data scource:
summer olympics:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Summer_Olympics_medal_table
winter olympics:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Winter_Olympics_medal_table

change 2016/2014 into desired year

- external components:
bootstrap

- similar:
there is a site that represents the medals won by country's over years, but this one uses bubles and is not interactive, also there
is no linked graph http://rio2016.thegamma.net/

  elsewhere they have a different visualization but once again very different http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/08/04/sports/olympics/20080804_MEDALCOUNT_MAP.html

- hardest parts:
staying sane when the code does not work
I think the scraping/getting data will take a lot of time
the hardest part will be linking the dropdown menus with the graph and the slider with the map and the map with the graph
