# day 1
mainly focussed on fixing bugs coming from DATA MAPS (map format i use). additionally i looked for how i wanted my stacked barchart to look like

# day 2
inplemented the stacked barchart, it represents data of the top x country's of the selected year

i have yet to decide how many country's i wil represent, but i think it will be 10.
maybe i will add a function where the country on the maps can be selected and will be added in the barchart

# day3
when a bar of the stacked bar chart is hovered then the matching country is given a defferent color in the
map

when a country on the map is clicked, a linegraph giving the olympic history of that country is shown

# day4
due to the weather there was not very much progress, i added a dropdown menu which can be used to select the amount of top country in the stackedbarchart. additionally a fixed some bugs and added some data

# day5

gathered the rest of the remaining data and did some debugging.

got some idee's from the presentations

# day6

the sliders of the years have been changed to only contain the years the olympics happendend and not when thy were skipped (examples: 1940, 1944, 1948). i decided to make the slider linear over the years that the Olympics took place.

the toggle to choose between summer and winter is now styled and fully functional
